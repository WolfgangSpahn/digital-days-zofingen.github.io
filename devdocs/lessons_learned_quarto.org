You can organize your Quarto project by placing your markdown source files in a separate folder like =src_md= and still compile them into the final
output (e.g., HTML, PDF, or other formats). Here's how you can do it:

*** Steps to Organize Markdown Files in a Subfolder

1. *Create the =src_md= Folder*:

   - In the root of your Quarto project, create a folder named =src_md=
     (or any other name you prefer).

2. *Move Markdown Files*:

   - Move all your existing markdown files (=.qmd=, =.md=, etc.) into
     the =src_md= folder.

3. *Update the =_quarto.yml= Configuration*:

   - In your =_quarto.yml= file (which is the configuration file for
     Quarto), you'll need to specify the input directory and the output
     options.
   - Here is an example of how to set up the =_quarto.yml= file:

   #+begin_src yaml
   project:
     type: website # or book, or article based on your output
     output-dir: _site  # Specify where the compiled output will go

   format:
     html:
       toc: true  # Example, table of contents for HTML

   execute:
     echo: true

   input-dir: src_md  # Specify the folder where your markdown files are located
   #+end_src

   This tells Quarto that your markdown files are in the =src_md=
   folder.

4. *Compiling the Project*:

   - When you run =quarto render=, Quarto will automatically look for
     the source markdown files in the =src_md= folder (as per the
     =input-dir= setting) and generate the output.

5. *Rendering Specific Files* (Optional):

   - If you want to render specific files from the =src_md= folder, you
     can do so by specifying the path directly in the =quarto render=
     command. For example:

     #+begin_src sh
     quarto render src_md/my_file.qmd
     #+end_src

6. *Organizing Output* (Optional):

   - If you want to further customize where the output files go, you can
     adjust the =output-dir= in =_quarto.yml=. This is useful if you
     want a separate folder for compiled files, e.g., =output/= instead
     of =_site=.

With this setup, your markdown source files will be neatly organized in
the =src_md= folder, and Quarto will still be able to compile them into
the desired output.
